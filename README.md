# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here you will find a curated selection of my most interesting and relevant projects completed over the past year.

Each project is organized into a separate folder, and within each folder, you will find a Python notebook with my work.

To help you navigate through each project, I have included a markdown file at the beginning of each notebook that contains all the necessary information to understand the content of the notebook.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these projects informative and engaging!
